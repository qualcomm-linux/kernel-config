This repo contains the configuration file used by the `automerge` tool to
merge the various git topic branches and create a new integration branch
`qcom-next`

Please send patches to update the qcom-next.conf file as per your team
needs.
 
There is also a ci.conf.sample file if you want to create your own
configuration file for local integration testing.
